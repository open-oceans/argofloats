Argo is an international program that collects information from inside the ocean using a fleet of robotic instruments that drift with the ocean currents and move up and down between the surface and a mid-water level. Each instrument (float) spends almost all its life below the surface. The name Argo was chosen because the array of floats works in partnership with the Jason earth observing satellites that measure the shape of the ocean surface. (In Greek mythology Jason sailed on his ship the Argo in search of the golden fleece). To learn more about Argo, how it works, [its data and technology, and its scientific and environmental impact, click here](https://argo.ucsd.edu/).

The argofloats tool builds on the argovis API and allows the user to perform basic operations like search for and export platform and profile data, parse metadata and so on and more functionality will be added to this tool in the future.
