Each instrument (float) spends almost all its life below the surface. The name Argo was chosen because the array of floats works in partnership with the Jason earth observing satellites that measure the shape of the ocean surface.

I would recommend the steps mentioned above to get the GDAL properly installed. However I am including instructions to using a precompiled version of GDAL similar to the other libraries on windows. You can test to see if you have gdal by simply running</p> <p><code>gdalinfo</code></p> <p>in your command prompt. If you get a read out and not an error message you are good to go.
